## C2Bridges
Developers can use the [C2Bridge](https://github.com/cobbr/C2Bridge) project as a template for creating new C2Bridges. Within the C2Bridge project, there is an abstract `C2Bridge` class. A developer can inherit from this class and implement the needed functions to read and write from implants to the BridgeListener using the new chosen C2 protocol.
