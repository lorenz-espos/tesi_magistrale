## How to collect Microsoft patches
## Patch extraction
* Newer patches packaged as EXEs support the /X flag for extraction. For example, the following will extract the patch under the same directory. Patches such as Internet Explorer 8 (for XP) can be extracted this way.
```
Windows[Something]-KB[Something]-x86-ENU.exe /X:.
```

## Checking gadgets in patches
The quickest way to check gadgets across different patches is by using Metasploit's msfpescan utility (or msfbinscan, which is smart enough to know it's PE format). It's really easy, all you have to do is put the DLLs in the same directory, and then do:
```
$ ./msfbinscan -D -a [address] -A 10 /patches/*.dll
```
