Arbitrary file upload is surprisingly common among web applications, which can be abused to upload malicious files and then compromise the server. Usually, the attacker will select a payload based on whatever server-side programming language is supported. So if the vulnerable app is in PHP, then clearly PHP is supported, therefore an easy choice would be using a PHP payload such as Metasploit's PHP meterpreter. However, the PHP meterpreter does not share the same performance as, say, a Windows meterpreter. So in reality, what happens is you will probably want to upgrade to a better shell, which involves extra manual work during the process. So why limit your payload options? For this type of scenario, you should use the
```PhpEXE```

### Requirements
To use the
```PhpEXE```

### Usage
First include the mixin under the scope of your
```MetasploitModule```

class like the following:
```ruby
include Msf::Exploit::PhpEXE
```

Generate the payload (with the PHP stager) with
```get_write_exec_payload```


```ruby
p = get_write_exec_payload
```

If you're working on a Linux target, then you can set
```unlink_self```

to true, which will automatically clear the executable:
```ruby
p = get_write_exec_payload(:unlink_self=>true)
```

At this point you can upload the payload generated by
```get_write_exec_payload```
