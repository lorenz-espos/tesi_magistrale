The "on_request_uri" method is also where you can create the HTTP response. Here's a couple of choices you can use to do that:

* **send_not_found(cli)** - Sends a 404 to the client. Make sure to pass the cli (socket) object.
* **send_redirect(cli, location='/', body='', headers={})** - Redirects the client to a new location.
* **send_response(cli, body, headers={})** - Sends a response to the client. This method is probably what you'll be using most of the time.

If you've seen some of our exploit modules, you will also see them using Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML instead of Exploit::Remote::HttpServer. Usage is mostly the same, the difference is the Exploit::Remote::HttpServer::HTML mixin gives you access to some Javascript functions like Base64, heap spraying, OS detection, etc.

Here's an example of sending a HTTP response:
