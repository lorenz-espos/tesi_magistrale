# Post exploitation modules

Some post exploitation modules have been developed for pupy, others use external github project written in python. 

## Shells
Depending on the system and context, you should launch system command using one of the following module: 
- `pyshell`: python shell (mainly used for debug)
- `pyexec`: run python commands - ex: `pyexec -c "import platform;print platform.uname()"`. 
- `shell_exec`: simple popen call
- `pexec`: simple popen call executed on a thread (slower but safer)
- `interactive_shell`: interactive shell. Modified version of [winpty](https://github.com/alxchk/winpty) used for windows. 

## Privilege escalation
- `Beroot`: find ways to elevate our privilege - from user to admin (windows/linux), check the [github](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/BeRoot) for more information. 
- `privesc_checker`: find well knows vulnerabilities on non up to date systems (windows/linux). [linux-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester) is used on linux and [windows-exploit-suggester](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/Windows-Exploit-Suggester) on windows. 
- `sudo_alias`: basic sudo alias (linux). 
- `bypassuac`: bypass uac when possible - admin privilege required (windows). Check [WinPwnage](https://github.com/rootm0s/WinPwnage) github for more information. 
- `getsystem`: once uac bypassed, get system privilege (windows). 

## Credentials
- `Lazagne`: retrieve lots of passwords stored on the system (windows/linux), check the [github](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/) for more information. 
- `creddump`: retrieve system hashes (windows/linux). 
- `hashmon`: crawl process memory to find system passwords (linux).
- `loot_memory`: crawl process memory to browsers passwords. 

Credentials found are stored on the local db and visible with the `cred` command: 
```
>> creds 
```

## Pivoting
- `forward`: use this module for port forwarding and proxy socks. 
- `ssh`: execute system commands on a remote ssh server. 
- `sshell`: get a full interactive session through a remote ssh server. 
- `psexec`: launch remote commands using smb or wmi protocols.
- `smb`: copy files via smb protocol.
- `smbspider`: find into remote shares available and grep for sensitive files/word.
