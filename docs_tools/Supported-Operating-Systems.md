# Supported operating systems

We only support Debian 9 (no derivatives) and Kali Rolling. However, it should work fine in Ubuntu as well. Additionally, support for any OS is provided if Pupy is run from the official Docker container.

Any issues reported for bare metal installations on any operating system besides Kali Rolling or Debian 9 will be closed. In addition, before reporting your issue, please verify that you can replicate it on a fully updated installation. If possible and convenient, we also appreciate it if you can replicate it on a _freshly installed_, fully updated VM.

Please note that Debian 9 is the only officially supported OS for building the docker container. Any issues related to building on any other OS will be closed.
