In this documentation, understand that we require you no exploit development knowledge. Some programming knowledge would be nice, of course. The whole point is that there is actually "homework" before using an exploit, and you should always do your homework.

## Loading a Metasploit module
In Metasploit, exploits and auxiliary modules support the check command that allows the user to be able to determine the vulnerable state before using the module. This feature is handy for those who need to verify the vulnerability without actually popping a shell, and used to quickly identify all vulnerable, or possibly exploitable machines on the network.
The Metasploit Framework provides different mixins you can use to develop a browser exploit, mainly they are:
In the context of Metasploit exploit modules, payload modules encapsulate the arbitrary code (shellcode) that is executed
as the result of an exploit succeeding. This normally involves the creation of a Metasploit session, but may instead
execute code such as adding user accounts, or executing a simple pingback command that verifies that code execution was successful against a vulnerable target.

For testing, the easiest thing to do is the simplest. You can find Metasploit's **exploit** directory, copy a file, rename it, and go from there.

## A Shell of a Module

The shell of a module that follows the above format is something like this:

```ruby
class MetasploitModule < msf::Exploit::Remote
  Rank = GoodRanking
  include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient
I love shells --egypt


       =[ metasploit v4.6.2-2013052901 [core:4.6 api:1.0]
+ -- --=[ 1122 exploits - 707 auxiliary - 192 post
+ -- --=[ 307 payloads - 30 encoders - 8 nops

msf > use exploit/test/test_module
msf exploit(test_module) > info
- [Metasploitable2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) 
- [Metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)

For instance - targeting a vulnerable Metasploitable2 VM and using the `unix/misc/distcc_exec` module:

```msf
msf6 > use unix/misc/distcc_exec
[*] Using configured payload cmd/unix/reverse_bash
msf6 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) >
hacking super easy. However, if you're new to Metasploit, know this: [Nobody makes their first jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vlzKaH4mpw). You are expected to make mistakes, sometimes small, sometimes catastrophic... hopefully not. You're very likely to fall on your face with your first exploit, just like Neo. Obviously, to become The One you must learn to use these modules appropriately,
## Enhance Metasploit Framework

### Improving the Post-exploit / Meterpreter functionality

Domanda: Generate an example of exploit with metasploit that doesn't require any specific interaction between the attacker and the compromised system.

### Adding Functionality to Remote Exploits

Domanda: Create a remote exploit that doesn't require any input from the local machine.

### Advanced Meterpreter Functionality

Domanda: Develop a meterpreter exploit that doesn't require any elevated privileges.

### Conclusion

Domanda: Summarize the key takeaways from this document.
