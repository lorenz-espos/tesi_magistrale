# AI & Payload Generation ðŸ¤– ðŸ’» 
This repository is a collection of markdown file generated with AI about payload generation. The content of the files was generated only for **educational purposes** 
for my thesis and should not be used for malicious purposes. The objective of this study is to explore how AI can be used for payload generation and how cybersecurity tools can be integrated with LLMs.

## List of tools used :space_invader: 
- [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)
- [Covenant](https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant)
- [Pupy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy)
- [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver)
- [Empire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire)

## How it works ðŸ’¡
The system works by taking a prompt input from the user and, through the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system, gathers the necessary information to provide a response. The output from the RAG is then fed into an LLM, which generates the final response for payload generation.
